# Arduino-Robots
My first arduino robot is called Black rover and it is powered by a Arduino Mega. It includes four motors for drive, one servo for the claw, and one servo for the neck. A gps, two ultrasonics, two encoders, and four rgb lights.
At the moment the robot just flashes a light show, moves the claw and neck, then drives forward. I plan is to have the untrasonic stop the robot when it sees a object then open the claw and pick up the object and move it out that way. 
The file that has all the code is blackrover.ino
